## Creation process

### 1.Strategy
It is a B2C Website for meditation beginners.

### 2.Scope
It will have minamilist design, so the context needed to be clear and consice. 
There is going to be a directional video.
Not many features, as the main priority is the visuals on all devices.

### 3.Structure
A large visual representational image on the home page below a clean simple heading and nav bar.
Why - bold benefits in text blocks that respond well to screen size changes.
How page - a breif explaination and large video with user controls.
Why page - a breif explaination and a simple form.

### 4.Skeleton

Using Balsamiq I created the wireframe for my site:

For a large view of each page please follow the links below:

[Where page](https://github.com/debbie-herridge/mindfull-meditation/blob/main/assets/images/balsamiq-page-three.png)

### 5.Surface

Using google fonts I chose Montserrat for the body text and Raleway as they paired well, making the title capitvating and the text easy to read.
For the colour scheme I choose grey for the text, opting for a darker grey for the headings and slightly lighter for the text. This is to enhance a subtle emphasis for the content on the ivory background.

## Page Features 

### Header and Nav
The navagation consist of three links, to sections 'why', 'where' and 'how'. It is large and bold.

### Main image
The main image is fitting for the page in what it shows and also the colour schemes. It also contains a motivation quote to inspire readers. Both image and text respond in a appealing way when the screen size is changed.

### Benefits section
Each benefit is contained in its own border to separate them and give them all an equal importance. Each benefit will react and fill the page in a captivating way.

### Video section
Video has been imported from YouTube with the credit to the creator below. The video must be in theme, simple and concise with a calming approach. It will talk the user through their first guided meditation session. They will be as large as possible on the screen so that the user can clearly see and follow it without having to leave the site.

### Sign up form
A sign up form is added at the bottom for users to input their name and email address for emailed tips and motivation. This will help further motivate the user to keep up with their journey even after leaving the website. Its simple with a large subscribe button to invite the user to join.

### Footer

#### Image
A large image in a similar theme and colour scheme to compliment the image below the header, this gives the feel of the site a more harmonizing feel. The image is centred so that even when reducing the screen size the man is the photo will always be in the middle.

#### Social Media links
Links to social media sites - Youtube, Twitter and Facebook. Are represented by their icons which gives a clean look to the footer.

### Future features
A 'back to the top' button would aid the navagation of the page saving users to scroll up to use the nav section again.

# Design changes 
The inital skeleton design was to have three pages, after writing the code and viewing it online the site lacked enough content to have a satisfying scroll. Therefore I transferred the code from the pages into my index file. I then decided to add the image to the footer to improve the overall look and feel when scrolling down the site.

# Testing

## HTML Validator 
Initially the code passes the HTML Validator with a bug as I had used to ID tags on the same div, one for the navagation and the other for the styling. I corrected this by removing the styling nav.

## CSS Validator
At first the code did not pass as I had not included a # before the hexidicamal colour. This was quickly resolved and so my code passed the validator.
