# **BE MINDFULL**

Be Mindfull is a website designed to help beginners into meditation. It has 3 sections for the user; the why section will explain the benefits to the user, the how section will ease the user into it and has a video for a guided meditation session, the where section includes a form for the user to sign up for tips and motivation. The overall visual design is clean and tranquil to resonate with the content and goal of the site, this will make users more susceptible to take their first step.
